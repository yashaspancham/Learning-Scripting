### **Task 19: Working with JSON (Data Parsing)**

In modern dev-ops, you’ll constantly deal with JSON data from APIs or config files.

**The Goal:**

1. You have a string containing JSON: `{"name": "Gemini", "status": "active"}`.
2. Parse this string and print only the value of **"status"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Python: The `json` Module**

Python has a built-in library. You use `json.loads()` (load string) to turn a JSON string into a Python dictionary.

#### **2. Bash: The `jq` Command**

Bash doesn't have a built-in JSON parser. The industry standard is a tool called **`jq`**.

* **Syntax:** `echo '{"key":"val"}' | jq -r '.key'`
* (The `-r` stands for "raw" output, so it removes the quotes).

**Try writing the Bash and Python versions for Task 19!** *(Note: For the Bash version, assume `jq` is installed on the system.)*
