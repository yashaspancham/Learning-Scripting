### **Task 17: Lists and Loops with Indices**

Sometimes you don't just want the *item* in a list; you also need to know its *position* (index).

**The Goal:**

1. Create a list/array of three fruits: `["apple", "banana", "cherry"]`.
2. Loop through them and print: **"Item [index]: [fruit]"**.
* *Example output: Item 0: apple*

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Python: `enumerate()**`

In Python, the most elegant way to get both index and value is the `enumerate()` function.

#### **2. Bash: Loop with Index**

Bash doesn't have an "enumerate" function. You have to use a C-style loop or loop through the **keys** of the array using `!`.

* **The Keys syntax:** `for i in "${!FRUITS[@]}"; do`
* **Accessing the value:** `"${FRUITS[$i]}"`

#### **3. Zero-Based Indexing**

Both languages start counting at **0**.
