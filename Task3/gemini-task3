### **Task 3: The "For" Loop**

In Python, you’re used to `for i in range()`. In Bash, we use `do` and `done` to wrap the loop.

**The Goal:**
Create two scripts that:

1. Loop through the numbers **1 to 10**.
2. Inside the loop, check if the number is **even or odd**.
3. Print **"X is even"** or **"X is odd"**.

### **New Bash Syntax to Learn**

**1. The Loop:**

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
    # code here
done

```

**2. The Modulo (Remainder) Operator:**
Bash handles math slightly differently. To check a remainder, you can use the `(( ))` syntax:

```bash
if (( i % 2 == 0 )); then
    echo "even"
fi

```

*(Note: Inside double parentheses `(( ))`, you don't need the `$` sign for variables and you can use standard math symbols like `==`, `>`, and `<`!)*

### **The Challenge:**

Try to write the **Bash version** first. Use the `for i in {1..10}; do` structure and try using the `(( i % 2 == 0 ))` trick for the even/odd check.
