### **Task 48: API Interaction (The POST Request)**

Most of the time, we don't just print JSON to the screen; we send it to a "Webhook" or an API (like sending an alert to Slack or a metric to a monitoring dashboard). This requires an **HTTP POST** request.

**The Goal:**

1. Take the JSON object you created in Task 47.
2. **Action:** Send that JSON to `https://httpbin.org/post`.
3. **Requirement:** You must set the "Content-Type" header to `application/json` so the server knows how to read your data.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `curl -X POST**`

To send data with curl, we use:

* `-X POST`: Changes the request type from GET to POST.
* `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`: Tells the server "I am sending JSON."
* `-d "$json_data"`: Attaches the actual data payload.

#### **2. Python: `requests.post()**`

The `requests` library makes this very intuitive. Instead of manually dumping the JSON to a string, you can use the `json=` parameter, and Python will automatically set the headers and format the data for you.

* `requests.post(url, json=data_dictionary)`

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 48?**

**Next Step:** Once you can send data to APIs, we'll reach **Task 49: Working with Environment Variables**. We'll learn how to hide "Secret" information (like API Keys) so they don't get leaked in your code. Ready to secure your scripts?
