### **Task 9: Environment Variables and Defaults**

Now that you can move data between files, let's look at how to get data from the **System Environment**.

**The Goal:**

1. Check for an **Environment Variable** named `USER_NAME`.
2. If it exists, print **"Hello, [USER_NAME]"**.
3. If it does **not** exist (or is empty), use a default value of **"Guest"** and print **"Hello, Guest"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Environment Variables**

These are variables that live in your terminal session, not just your script. You can set one while running your script like this:

* `USER_NAME=Bob python3 script.py`
* `USER_NAME=Bob bash script.sh`

#### **2. Bash: Checking for Empty Strings**

To check if a variable is empty, we use the `-z` flag inside brackets:
`if [ -z "$USER_NAME" ]; then`

#### **3. Python: `os.environ**`

To talk to the system, Python needs the `os` module. You can access variables like a dictionary:
`name = os.environ.get("USER_NAME", "Guest")`
*(Note: The second part of `.get()` is the default value if the key is missing!)*

#### **4. Bash Shorthand for Defaults**

Bash has a very cool trick for defaults: `${VAR:-default}`. This means "Use $VAR, but if it's empty, use 'default'".

**Can you try writing the Bash and Python versions for Task 9?**
