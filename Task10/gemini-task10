### **Task 10: Exit Codes and Error Handling**

Every time a command runs in Bash or a script finishes in Python, it sends back a "status report" called an **Exit Code**.

* **0** = Success.
* **Anything else (1-255)** = Failure.

**The Goal:**

1. Create a script that checks if a file named `config.txt` exists.
2. **If it exists:** Print "Config found" and exit with code **0**.
3. **If it doesn't exist:** Print "Error: Config missing" and exit with code **1**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `$?` Variable**

This special variable always holds the exit code of the *last* command that ran. You can also use the `exit` command to stop your script and set a code.
`exit 1`

#### **2. Bash: File Testing**

To check if a file exists, use the `-f` flag:
`if [ -f "filename" ]; then`

#### **3. Python: `sys.exit()**`

To exit a Python script with a specific code, you use `sys.exit()`.
`import sys`
`sys.exit(1)`

#### **4. Python: Checking File Existence**

There are two common ways:

* `os.path.exists("filename")`
* `from pathlib import Path` -> `Path("filename").exists()`
