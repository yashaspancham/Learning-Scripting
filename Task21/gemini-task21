### **Task 21: Dates and Timestamps**

Automation often requires naming files with the current date or logging exactly when an event happened.

**The Goal:**

1. Get the current system date and time.
2. Format it as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM`.
3. Create a variable for a filename like `backup_[TIMESTAMP].zip` and print it.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `date` Command**

Bash uses the system `date` utility. You can format the output using a `+` followed by specific codes.

* **Syntax:** `$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M")`

#### **2. Python: The `datetime` Module**

Python uses a library for this. You get the current time and then use `.strftime()` (**str**ing **f**ormat **time**) to make it look the way you want.

* **Syntax:** `now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M")`

#### **3. Common Formatting Codes**

Both languages share very similar codes:

* `%Y`: 4-digit year (2026)
* `%m`: Month (02)
* `%d`: Day (03)
* `%H`: Hour (24h format)
* `%M`: Minute
