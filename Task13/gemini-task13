### **Task 13: Search and Replace (The "Sed" and "Replace" Task)**

This is a classic automation task. We want to take a string and swap one word for another.

**The Goal:**

1. Start with a variable containing the string: `"The server is DOWN"`.
2. Change the word `"DOWN"` to `"UP"`.
3. Print the new string.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `sed` Command**

`sed` (Stream Editor) is the ultimate tool for finding and replacing text in Bash. The syntax is:
`echo $VAR | sed 's/SEARCH/REPLACE/'`
*(The `s` stands for substitute).*

#### **2. Python: The `.replace()` Method**

Strings in Python have a built-in method for this:
`new_string = old_string.replace("OLD", "NEW")`

#### **3. Bash: Parameter Expansion (The Shortcut)**

Bash actually has a built-in way to do this without `sed`:
`${VAR/SEARCH/REPLACE}`
