### **Task 15: The "Infinite" Loop with a Break**

Sometimes we want a script to keep running until a specific condition is met (like waiting for a server to start or a user to type "exit").

**The Goal:**

1. Create a loop that runs "forever."
2. Inside the loop, increment a counter starting from 1.
3. Print the counter value.
4. Use an `if` statement to check if the counter has reached **5**.
5. If it is 5, print **"Limit reached, exiting"** and **break** out of the loop.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. The Infinite Loop**

* **Bash:** `while true; do`
* **Python:** `while True:`

#### **2. The `break` Command**

In both languages, the `break` command immediately stops the loop it is currently inside.

#### **3. Sleeping (Delaying)**

To prevent the script from running too fast and eating up your CPU, it's common to add a small pause:

* **Bash:** `sleep 1` (pauses for 1 second).
* **Python:** `import time` then `time.sleep(1)`.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 15?**
