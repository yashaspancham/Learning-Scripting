### **Task 49: Environment Variables (Protecting Secrets)**

In the scripts you just wrote, you included a Webhook URL. If you were using a "Bot Token" or a "Database Password," you should **never** hardcode them in the script. If you push that code to GitHub, anyone can see your secrets. Instead, we use **Environment Variables**.

**The Goal:**

1. Read a secret API Key from the system environment.
2. If the key exists, print: **"API Key found: [first 4 characters]****"**.
3. If it doesn't exist, print: **"Error: API_KEY environment variable not set!"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `export` and `${VAR}**`

* **Setting it (Terminal):** `export API_KEY="secret-12345"`
* **Reading it (Script):** Use `$API_KEY`.
* **Checking Existence:** Use the `-z` flag (checks if a string is empty).
`if [ -z "$API_KEY" ]; then ...`

#### **2. Python: `os.environ**`

Python accesses the system's environment through the `os` module.

* `import os`
* `key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")`: Using `.get()` is safer because it returns `None` if the variable isn't found instead of crashing your script.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 49?**
*(Note: To test this, you'll need to run `export API_KEY=mysecret` in your terminal before running your script!)*

**Next Step:** After securing your variables, we'll hit **Task 50: The Master Script (Putting it all together)**. This will be your "Final Boss" task where you combine everything—system specs, health checks, and API reporting—into one professional DevOps tool. Ready for the big one?
