### **Task 46: Parsing JSON Data (The API Key)**

In the DevOps world, almost every tool communicates in **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation). If you ask AWS for a list of servers, or GitHub for a list of commits, they will send you a structured block of text. You need to know how to "drill down" into that text to get exactly what you need.

**The Goal:**

1. You have a JSON string (provided below).
2. **Action:** Extract the value of the "status" and the "ip" address from the JSON.
3. **JSON Data:**
`{"server": {"id": "aws-123", "status": "running", "network": {"ip": "10.0.0.5", "type": "private"}}}`

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `jq` (The JSON Processor)**

Bash isn't naturally good at reading JSON, so we use a powerful tool called `jq`. It uses a "dot" notation to navigate keys.

* **To get status:** `echo $json | jq -r '.server.status'`
* **To get IP:** `echo $json | jq -r '.server.network.ip'`
* The `-r` flag stands for "raw"—it removes the double quotes from the output.

#### **2. Python: The `json` Module**

Python treats JSON like a **Dictionary**. Once you load it, you access data using square brackets.

* `import json`
* `data = json.loads(json_string)`
* `status = data["server"]["status"]`

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 46?**
*(Note: For Bash, assume you have a variable `json_data='{"server": ...}'`. For Python, use the same string.)*

**Next Step:** After parsing simple JSON, we'll go to **Task 47: Generating JSON**. We'll learn how to take system info (like the CPU/RAM you got in Task 38) and turn it into a JSON object to send to a monitoring dashboard. Ready to create your own data?
