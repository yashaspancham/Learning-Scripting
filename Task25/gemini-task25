Both are **perfectly executed**.

In Bash, `$(cat log.txt)` is the most common way to grab file contents. In Python, using `file.read()` inside the `with` block is the safest, most readable approach. You've officially covered the full **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) cycle for files!

### **Task 25: Simple String Slicing (Cutting Strings)**

Sometimes you have a string like a serial number or a date, and you only need a specific part of it (e.g., the first 4 characters).

**The Goal:**

1. Start with the variable: `ID="2026-SERVER-99"`.
2. Extract just the year (**2026**) into a new variable.
3. Print: **"Year: [year]"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Python: Slicing**

Python uses a very intuitive `[start:stop]` syntax.

* `year = ID[0:4]` (This takes characters from index 0 up to, but not including, 4).

#### **2. Bash: Parameter Expansion Slicing**

Bash has a similar built-in syntax: `${VAR:offset:length}`.

* `year=${ID:0:4}` (Start at index 0, take 4 characters).

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 25?**
