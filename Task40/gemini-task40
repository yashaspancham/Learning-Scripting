### **Task 40: Security Automation (Password Expiry)**

As a DevOps or System Administrator, you don't want to find out a service account's password expired because the website suddenly went down. You write scripts to "audit" these dates.

**The Goal:**

1. Check when the password for the user `developer` was last changed.
2. For this task, simply **extract and print** the "Last Password Change" date.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `chage` Command**

The `chage` (Change Age) command is the primary tool for managing password aging.

* `chage -l username`: Lists all aging details (expiry, last change, etc.).
* To get just the date, we usually combine it with `grep` and `cut`.
* **Example:** `chage -l developer | grep "Last password change" | cut -d: -f2`

#### **2. Python: Reading `/etc/shadow` (The Hard Way)**

Python’s `pwd` module doesn't show password dates for security reasons. To get this info, you usually have to read `/etc/shadow` (which requires **root/sudo** permissions).

* Since reading `/etc/shadow` is complex for a beginner, a common DevOps "bridge" is to use Python to run the Bash `chage` command and parse the result.
* **Method:** `subprocess.check_output(["chage", "-l", "developer"])`.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 40?**
*(Note: Since you might not have a user named `developer`, feel free to use your own username to test it. You may need to run these with `sudo`!)*

**Next Step:** Now that we've covered users and security, we'll move to **Task 41: SSH Connectivity**. We'll learn how to check if you can log into a *remote* server without actually staying logged in. This is the first step toward Multi-Server automation! Ready to go remote?
