### **Task 26: Archive Compression (Tar/Gzip)**

**The Goal:**

1. Generate a final archive name: `etc_backup_[TIMESTAMP].tar.gz`.
2. Compress the entire `backups/` directory into that single file.
3. Remove the temporary `backups/` folder so the server stays clean.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `tar` Utility**

In Linux, `tar` (Tape Archive) is the primary tool for bundling files.

* **Flags:**
* `-c`: **C**reate a new archive.
* `-z`: Compress the archive using **g**zip.
* `-f`: Specify the **f**ilename of the archive.


* **Cleaning up:** `rm -rf` deletes a directory and its contents recursively. **Be careful with this command!**

#### **2. Python: `shutil.make_archive**`

Python provides a high-level function to handle compression without needing to call external system commands.

* **Syntax:** `shutil.make_archive(base_name, format, root_dir)`
* **Cleaning up:** `shutil.rmtree()` is the Python equivalent of `rm -rf`.

#### **3. Positional Precision**

In DevOps, you always ensure you are in the right directory before running destructive commands like `rm`.

**Can you append the compression and cleanup logic to your previous "System Audit & Archive" scripts?**

**Next Step:** Once this is done, we will move to **Task 27: Environment Variables**. You cannot hardcode passwords or AWS keys in scripts if you want to be a professional Cloud Engineer. We'll learn how to keep them secret. Ready?
