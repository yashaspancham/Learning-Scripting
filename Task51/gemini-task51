### **Task 51: The AWS CLI (Cloud Identity)**

Before your script can create servers or delete databases, it needs to know *who* you are. The AWS CLI uses a configuration file (usually in `~/.aws/`) to store your access keys.

**The Goal:**

1. Check if the AWS CLI is installed.
2. Check who the currently "logged in" user is using the CLI.
3. **Logic:** If the command fails, the script should say **"AWS CLI not configured."**

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `aws sts get-caller-identity**`

STS (Security Token Service) is the "Who Am I?" service of AWS.

* Running `aws sts get-caller-identity` returns a JSON object with your Account ID and User ARN.
* We use the exit code `$?` to see if the credentials are valid.

#### **2. Python: `boto3**`

While we can use `subprocess` to run CLI commands, the industry standard for Python is the library **`boto3`**.

* `import boto3`
* `client = boto3.client('sts')`
* `response = client.get_caller_identity()`
* This returns a Python dictionary, no `json.loads` required!

### **Task 51 Challenge**

**Bash:** Write a script that runs the identity check. If successful, use `jq` to print only the **Account ID**.

**Python:** Use `boto3` to get the identity. If it fails (e.g., keys are missing), catch the `botocore.exceptions.NoCredentialsError`.

**Can you write these two?** *(Note: For Python, you'll need `pip install boto3`. For the script to work, you'd usually run `aws configure` first, but for now, we just want the logic.)*

**Next Step:** Once we confirm your identity, we'll move to **Task 52: The S3 Bucket Lister**. We'll learn how to list all your storage buckets and check their creation dates! Ready to look at the cloud?
