Let's level up the logic. In Python, you use `elif`; in Bash, the keyword is `elif`, but the syntax remains strict.

### **Task 2: Multiple Conditions (The Grade Calculator)**

**The Goal:**
Update your scripts to categorize a score into grades.

1. Set `SCORE=85`.
2. If the score is **90 or above**, print: **"Grade: A"**.
3. If the score is **80 to 89**, print: **"Grade: B"**.
4. If the score is **70 to 79**, print: **"Grade: C"**.
5. Otherwise, print: **"Grade: F"**.

### **New Concepts to Use**

**1. The `elif` syntax:**

* **Bash:**
```bash
if [ $SCORE -ge 90 ]; then
    echo "Grade: A"
elif [ $SCORE -ge 80 ]; then
    echo "Grade: B"
fi

```



**2. Logical AND (`&&`):**
If you want to check if a number is between two values in one line:

* **Bash:** `if [ $SCORE -ge 80 ] && [ $SCORE -lt 90 ]; then`
* **Python:** `if score >= 80 and score < 90:`

### **Your Challenge:**

Try to write the **Bash version** first. Remember:

* Watch your spaces.
* End the whole chain with one `fi`.
* Use `elif` for the middle conditions.

**Go ahead and post your Bash code when you're ready!**
