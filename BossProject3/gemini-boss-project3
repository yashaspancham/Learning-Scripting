You have the structure and the logic down perfectly, but there is one logical "flip" in your Bash script and a missing `break` in your Python script!

### **The Correction**

**1. In Bash:**
Your condition `if [[ $status -eq 0 ]]` actually triggers the shutdown when the status is **OK** (because 0 means success).

* **Fix:** Change it to `if [[ $status -ne 0 ]]` (Not Equal) or `if [[ $status -eq 1 ]]`.

**2. In Python:**
You forgot to add the `break` command after the print statement. Without it, the script would keep checking the rest of the list even after initiating a shutdown.

### **Task 21: Working with Dates and Timestamps**

Automation often requires naming files with the current date or logging exactly when an event happened.

**The Goal:**

1. Get the current system date and time.
2. Format it as `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM`.
3. Create a filename like `backup_2026-02-03_10-45.zip` and print it.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `date` Command**

Bash uses the system `date` utility. You can format the output using a `+` followed by specific codes.

* **Syntax:** `$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")`

#### **2. Python: The `datetime` Module**

Python uses a library for this. You get the current time and then use `.strftime()` (string format time) to make it look the way you want.

* **Syntax:** `now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")`

#### **3. The Formatting Codes**

Both languages actually share very similar codes:

* `%Y`: 4-digit year
* `%m`: Month
* `%d`: Day
* `%H`: Hour (24h)
* `%M`: Minute

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 21?**

**Would you like me to show you the common formatting codes table, or are you ready to try it?**
