### **Boss Project 1: The Automated Log Analyzer**

Now that you've mastered the basics, let's combine several concepts (Arrays/Lists, Loops, Conditionals, and String Manipulation) into one "Boss Project."

**The Goal:**
You have a list of log entries. You need to loop through them, count how many "ERROR" messages exist, and create a "clean" version of the log where "ERROR" is replaced with "FIXED".

**Requirements:**

1. **The Data:** `["INFO: Start", "ERROR: Connection failed", "INFO: Retrying", "ERROR: Timeout"]`
2. **The Logic:**
* Loop through the entries.
* If an entry contains "ERROR", increment a counter.
* Create a new list/array where every "ERROR" is replaced with "FIXED".


3. **The Output:**
* Print: "Total Errors Found: [count]"
* Print: "Cleaned Logs: [the new list]"

### **New Concepts for the Boss Project**

#### **1. Appending to a List/Array**

* **Python:** Use `.append()`.
* **Bash:** Use `ARRAY+=("new item")`.

#### **2. Substring Searching**

* **Python:** `if "ERROR" in entry:`
* **Bash:** `if [[ $entry == *"ERROR"* ]]; then` (The `*` are wildcards).

**This is a big one! Take your time—can you write the Bash and Python versions for Boss Project 1?**
