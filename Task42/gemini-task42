### **Task 42: Moving Data (Automated SCP)**

Checking connectivity is step one; moving files is step two. As a DevOps Engineer, you'll often need to push updated configurations or pull logs from a remote server.

**The Goal:**

1. Copy a file named `backup.tar.gz` from your local machine to the `/tmp` folder on a remote server (`3.7.55.8`).
2. Like the previous task, ensure it doesn't hang forever if the connection is slow.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `scp` Command**

`scp` (Secure Copy) uses the same engine as SSH.

* **Syntax:** `scp [options] [source] [user@host:destination]`
* You can use the same `-o` flags we used in SSH to keep the script from hanging.
* **Example:** `scp -o ConnectTimeout=5 backup.tar.gz user@3.7.55.8:/tmp/`

#### **2. Python: `subprocess` for SCP**

While there are libraries like `paramiko` for SSH/SCP, in simple DevOps scripts, we usually stick to `subprocess` because it's already installed on every Linux machine.

* Use `subprocess.run` just like you did for the SSH check.
* **Logic:** Check the `returncode`. If it's `0`, the file was transferred successfully.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 42?**

**Next Step:** After moving files, we'll reach **Task 43: Remote Command Execution**. We'll learn how to tell the remote server to "Unzip this file I just sent you." Ready to control servers from a distance?
