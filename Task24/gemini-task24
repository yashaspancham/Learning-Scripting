### **Task 24: Reading from a File**

Now let's do the opposite: pull that data back out of the file and into a variable.

**The Goal:**

1. Open the file `log.txt` that you just created.
2. Read the contents into a variable.
3. Print the variable with a prefix: **"File Content: [content]"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: Command Substitution or `cat**`

The easiest way to get file content into a variable is using `$(cat filename)`.

* **Example:** `VAR=$(cat log.txt)`

#### **2. Python: The `.read()` Method**

Just like writing, you use the `with open` block, but change the mode to `'r'` (read).

* **Example:** `content = file.read()`

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 24?**
