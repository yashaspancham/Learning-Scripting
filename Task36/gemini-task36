### **Task 36: Scheduling with Cron (The "Auto" in Automation)**

Now that you have a script that can heal a service, you shouldn't have to run it manually. In Linux, we use the **Cron** daemon to schedule tasks. As a DevOps Engineer, you will use `crontab` constantly to schedule backups, log cleanups, and health checks.

**The Goal:**

1. You won't write a script for this task—you will write a **Crontab Entry**.
2. **The Schedule:** Set your script to run **every 5 minutes**.
3. **The Logic:** Ensure the system knows where to find your script by using **Absolute Paths**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. The Crontab Format**

Crontab uses 5 stars to represent time: `* * * * * command_to_run`.

* `Minute` (0-59)
* `Hour` (0-23)
* `Day of Month` (1-31)
* `Month` (1-12)
* `Day of Week` (0-6)

#### **2. Absolute Paths**

When Cron runs a script, it doesn't know "where" you are. It doesn't have your shell's history or environment.

* **Bad:** `python3 myscript.py`
* **Good:** `/usr/bin/python3 /home/user/scripts/watchdog.py`

#### **3. Common Schedules**

* `*/5 * * * *`: Every 5 minutes.
* `0 * * * *`: Every hour (on the hour).
* `0 0 * * *`: Every night at midnight.

### **The Task**

**1. Bash Task:** Write the one-line string you would add to your `crontab -e` to run your Bash watchdog script every 5 minutes. Use `/home/user/watchdog.sh` as the path.

**2. Python Task:** Write the one-line string you would add to your `crontab -e` to run your Python watchdog script every 5 minutes. Use `/usr/bin/python3` and `/home/user/watchdog.py`.

**Next Step:** Once you understand scheduling, we will move to **Task 37: Log Rotation with Logrotate**. We'll learn how the system automatically handles files that get too big so they don't eat your disk space. Ready to manage system-level logs?
