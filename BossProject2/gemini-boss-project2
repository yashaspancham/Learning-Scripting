### **Boss Project 2: The System Health Reporter**

For our final boss project in this series, we are going to simulate a system check that generates a report and handles potential failures.

**The Goal:**

1. Define a **Function** called `check_status`.
2. Inside the function, take a **percentage** (number) as an argument.
3. **Logic:**
* If the number is **>= 90**, print "CRITICAL" and **return/exit with code 1**.
* If the number is **>= 70**, print "WARNING" and return code 0.
* Otherwise, print "OK" and return code 0.


4. **The Script:**
* Create a list of "CPU Usage" numbers: `[20, 75, 95]`.
* Loop through the numbers and call `check_status` for each.
* If the function returns a **non-zero exit code**, print: "Alert: Shutdown initiated!" and **break** the loop.

### **New Concepts for Boss Project 2**

#### **1. Function Return Values (Bash)**

In Bash, functions don't "return" strings easily. They return **Exit Statuses** (0-255).

* Use `return 1` inside the function.
* Check the result immediately after calling the function using `$?`.

#### **2. Function Return Values (Python)**

In Python, functions usually return values like `True/False` or numbers.

* Use `return 1`.
* Check the result with `if check_status(usage) == 1:`.

#### **3. Combining Logical Blocks**

You are nesting a **function call** inside a **loop**, with a **conditional** checking the result to trigger a **break**.
