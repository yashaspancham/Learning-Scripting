### **Task 44: Web Service Health (HTTP Status)**

Checking if a server is "Up" with Ping or SSH is great, but just because the server is on doesn't mean the **website** is working. A DevOps engineer needs to verify that the web service (like Nginx or a Python API) is returning a **200 OK** status.

**The Goal:**

1. Check if `http://3.108.53.182` is responding.
2. **Logic:**
* If the status code is **200**, print: **"Website is Live."**
* If it's anything else (like 404 or 500), print: **"Website Error: [Status Code]"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `curl` with `--write-out**`

Normally, `curl` prints the whole webpage. To get just the status code, we use special formatting.

* `-s`: Silent mode (hides progress bars).
* `-o /dev/null`: Throws away the actual HTML content.
* `-w "%{http_code}"`: Tells curl to only print the 3-digit status code.
* **Example:** `status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://google.com)`

#### **2. Python: The `requests` Library**

While you can use `urllib`, the industry standard is the `requests` library. It makes handling web traffic incredibly simple.

* `import requests`
* `response = requests.get("http://3.108.53.182", timeout=5)`
* `response.status_code`: Gives you the integer (e.g., 200).

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 44?** *(Note: For Python, you might need to use a `try/except` block to catch `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` in case the server is completely down.)*

**Next Step:** Once you can check a single URL, we'll move to **Task 45: Bulk Health Checks**. We'll learn how to loop through a **list** of URLs to check an entire fleet of websites at once. Ready to scale up?
