### **Task 11: Introduction to Lists and Arrays**

Until now, we've mostly handled single variables. Now, let's look at how to store a collection of items and perform an action on all of them.

**The Goal:**

1. Create a list (Python) / array (Bash) of three colors: `red`, `green`, `blue`.
2. Loop through the list/array.
3. For each color, print: **"Color: [color_name]"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash Arrays**

Creating an array in Bash uses parentheses with **spaces** (no commas!):
`COLORS=("red" "green" "blue")`

To access **all** items in the array for a loop, you use a special syntax:
`for COLOR in "${COLORS[@]}"; do`

#### **2. Python Lists**

You likely know this one well, but it's the foundation of Python data:
`colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]`

#### **3. The Difference in Syntax**

* **Bash:** Uses `${ARRAY[@]}` to expand the list.
* **Python:** The list is an object you can iterate over directly.

**Can you try writing the Bash and Python versions for Task 11?**
