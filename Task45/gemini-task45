### **Task 45: Bulk Health Checks (Scaling Up)**

**The Goal:**

1. Create a list/array containing three URLs.
2. Loop through them and perform the health check you just wrote.
3. Print the status for each one clearly.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: Array Definition and Looping**

To handle multiple items in Bash, we use parentheses for the array and a specific loop syntax.

* **Array:** `urls=("http://site1.com" "http://site2.com")`
* **Loop:** `for url in "${urls[@]}"; do ... done`
* The `"${urls[@]}"` ensures that even if a URL has a weird character, it’s treated as one single item.

#### **2. Python: Graceful Loop Handling**

In a loop, if one URL fails (e.g., a "Connection Refused" error), you don't want the whole script to stop.

* Put the `try/except` **inside** the `for` loop.
* This way, if site #1 fails, the `except` block handles it, and the loop naturally moves to site #2.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 45?**

**Next Step:** Once you can monitor a fleet of sites, we’ll move to **Task 46: Parsing JSON Data**. This is how you'll interact with Cloud APIs (like AWS or GitHub) to get specific information like "Instance ID" or "Commit Message." Ready to handle some structured data?
