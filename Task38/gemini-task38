### **Task 38: System Specs (CPU & RAM)**

In DevOps, before you run a heavy task (like a database migration or video processing), your script should check if the server has enough "muscle" (RAM and CPU) to handle it.

**The Goal:**

1. Get the **Total RAM** available on the system.
2. Get the **Number of CPU cores**.
3. Print: **"System has [X] Cores and [Y] MB of RAM."**

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `/proc` filesystem**

Linux stores system info in a "virtual" folder called `/proc`. It’s not real files on a disk; it's a window into the Kernel.

* **CPU Cores:** `nproc` is the easiest command, or you can count lines in `/proc/cpuinfo`.
* **RAM:** `free -m` shows memory in Megabytes. We usually use `awk` to grab the "Total" value from the second line.

#### **2. Python: `os.cpu_count()` and `psutil**`

Python has built-in ways to see hardware without parsing text files.

* `os.cpu_count()`: Returns the number of logical CPUs.
* `psutil.virtual_memory()`: Provides a detailed breakdown of RAM (though if you don't have `psutil` installed, we can read `/proc/meminfo` using standard file opening).

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 38?**
*(Hint for Bash RAM: `free -m | awk '/Mem:/ {print $2}'` is a very clean way to get the total.)*

**Next Step:** Once you can read the hardware, we'll move to **Task 39: User Management**. We'll learn how to check if a specific user (like "admin") exists on the system. This is crucial for security automation! Ready?
