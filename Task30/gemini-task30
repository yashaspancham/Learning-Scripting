### **Task 30: Signal Handling (The "Graceful Exit")**

In DevOps, scripts often run for a long time (like a migration or a large backup). If a user hits **Ctrl+C** or the system sends a shutdown signal, you don't want the script to just "snap" out of existence—you want it to clean up temporary files or log exactly where it stopped.

**The Goal:**

1. Write a script that runs an infinite loop (printing "Working..." every second).
2. If the user interrupts it (SIGINT / Ctrl+C):
* **Catch** that signal.
* Print **"Cleanup in progress... Goodbye!"**
* **Exit** the script cleanly.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `trap` Command**

Bash uses `trap` to execute code when it receives a specific signal.

* **Signals to know:** `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C), `SIGTERM` (Termination), `EXIT` (Whenever the script finishes).
* **Syntax:** `trap "commands_to_run" SIGNAL`

#### **2. Python: The `signal` Module**

Python uses a handler function that gets triggered when a signal is received.

* **Syntax:** `signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, handler_function)`
* The handler function usually takes two arguments: `(sig, frame)`.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 30?** (Hint: In Python, you'll need `import time` for the loop, and in Bash, use `sleep 1`).

**Next Step:** Once you master signals, we move to **Task 31: Networking & Connectivity**. We'll learn how to check if a website or a server is "alive" before we try to deploy code to it! Ready?
