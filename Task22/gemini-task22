### **Task 22: Checking if a File or Directory Exists**

In automation, you should always check if a file exists before you try to read it, move it, or delete it. This prevents "File Not Found" errors.

**The Goal:**

1. Define a variable `FILENAME="config.txt"`.
2. Check if that file exists in the current directory.
3. If it exists, print **"File found, proceeding..."**.
4. If it doesn't, print **"Error: File missing"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: File Operators**

Bash has built-in flags for file testing inside `[[ ]]`.

* `-f`: True if the file exists and is a **regular file**.
* `-d`: True if the path is a **directory**.
* `-e`: True if the path **exists** (file or directory).

#### **2. Python: The `os.path` or `pathlib` Module**

Most people use the `os` module for simple checks.

* `import os`
* `os.path.exists(FILENAME)`
* `os.path.isfile(FILENAME)`

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 22?** (Try to use the `-f` flag for Bash and `os.path.isfile` for Python to be specific about it being a file).

**Would you like me to show you how to check for directories as well?**
