### **Task 16: Handling Command Line Flags (The "Case" Statement)**

As scripts get more complex, you often want to give users options, like `./script.sh --start` or `./script.sh --stop`.

**The Goal:**

1. Take the **first** command-line argument ($1 in Bash, sys.argv[1] in Python).
2. Use a "Switch" or "Case" logic to check the input:
* If it's `"start"`, print **"System starting..."**.
* If it's `"stop"`, print **"System stopping..."**.
* For anything else, print **"Invalid option"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: The `case` Statement**

Instead of many `if/elif` blocks, Bash uses `case`. It’s cleaner for matching strings. Note the `;;` used to end each section and `esac` (case spelled backwards) to end the block.

#### **2. Python: `match-case` (Python 3.10+)**

Modern Python has a `match` statement that works very similarly to Bash's `case`. For older versions, people use `if/elif`.

#### **3. Wildcards in Case**

* In Bash, `*)` acts as the "default" or "else" case.
* In Python, `case _:` acts as the "default".

**Can you try writing Task 16 using `case` for Bash and either `match` or `if/elif` for Python?**
