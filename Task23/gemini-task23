### **Task 23: Writing to a File (Redirection vs. File Handles)**

Now that we know how to check for a file, let's learn how to create one and put data inside it.

**The Goal:**

1. Create a variable `CONTENT="Update complete"`.
2. Write that content into a file named `log.txt`.
3. **Important:** In Python, ensure the file is closed properly after writing. In Bash, overwrite the file if it already exists.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: Redirection Operators**

* `>` : Overwrites the file with new content.
* `>>` : Appends new content to the end of the existing file.

> **Note:** If the file doesn't exist, both will create it.

#### **2. Python: The `with` Statement (Context Manager)**

The modern way to handle files in Python is using `with open(...)`. This automatically closes the file for you, even if an error occurs.

* `'w'` : Write mode (overwrites).
* `'a'` : Append mode.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 23?** (Use the "overwrite" mode for both).

**Would you like me to explain what happens if the directory for the file doesn't exist?**
