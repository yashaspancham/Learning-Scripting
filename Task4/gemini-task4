### **Task 4: The "While" Loop and User Input**

This task introduces **Interactivity**. We want the script to wait for the user to type something.

**The Goal:**

1. Set a variable `SECRET` to `7`.
2. Ask the user: "Guess the secret number (1-10):".
3. Use a **while loop** to keep asking as long as their guess is **not equal** to the secret.
4. When they get it right, print: "Correct! The secret was 7."

### **New Bash Syntax to Learn**

**1. Reading Input:**
In Python, you use `input()`. In Bash, you use `read`:

```bash
echo "Enter something:"
read USER_INPUT

```

**2. While Loop Syntax:**

```bash
while [ $GUESS -ne $SECRET ]; do
    # code
done

```

**3. The "Not Equal" operator:**

* **Bash (Integers):** `-ne`
* **Python:** `!=`

### **The Challenge:**

Try to write the **Bash version** first.

**Tip:** You'll need to ask for the first `read` **before** the loop starts, and then another `read` **inside** the loop so the user can try again!

**Show me your Bash script when you're ready.**
