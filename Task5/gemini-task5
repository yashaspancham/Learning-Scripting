### **Task 5: Working with Files (Automation Basics)**

This is the "final boss" of the basics. We are going to combine **loops**, **conditionals**, and **file system commands**.

**The Goal:**

1. Create a loop that creates 5 empty files named `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, up to `file5.txt`.
2. Then, write a **second loop** that looks at all files in the current folder.
3. If a file's name contains the number **3**, print: **"Found the special file: file3.txt"**.
4. Otherwise, print: **"Checking: [filename]"**.

### **New Bash Syntax to Learn**

**1. Creating a file:**
Use the `touch` command: `touch filename.txt`.

**2. Wildcards (Globbing):**
To loop over files in a folder:

```bash
for FILE in *.txt; do
    echo $FILE
done

```

**3. Pattern Matching in an If-Statement:**
To check if a string contains a character (like the number 3):

* **Bash:** `if [[ $FILE == *3* ]]; then` (The `*` are wildcards).
* **Python:** `if "3" in filename:`

### **The Challenge:**

Try to write the **Bash version** first.

**Structure hint:**

1. Use one `for` loop to `touch` the 5 files.
2. Use a second `for` loop to iterate through `*.txt` and use the `[[ ... ]]` syntax for the string check.
