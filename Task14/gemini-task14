### **Task 14: Multiple Conditions (If-Elif-Else)**

Now we’ll handle more than two paths by categorizing a value into three different "buckets."

**The Goal:**

1. Set a variable `TEMP` (Temperature).
2. If `TEMP` is greater than **30**, print **"Hot"**.
3. If `TEMP` is between **15 and 30** (inclusive), print **"Warm"**.
4. Otherwise (below 15), print **"Cold"**.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Multiple Conditions (`elif`)**

Both languages use `elif` to check secondary conditions if the first `if` fails.

#### **2. Logical "AND" Operators**

To check if a number is between two values:

* **Bash:** Use `-a` or the more modern `&&` inside `[[ ]]`.
* *Example:* `[[ $VAL -ge 15 && $VAL -le 30 ]]`


* **Python:** You can use the word `and` or the chain comparison `15 <= temp <= 30`.

#### **3. Comparison Operators**

| Logic | Bash (Integers) | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Greater than or equal | `-ge` | `>=` |
| Less than or equal | `-le` | `<=` |
| Greater than | `-gt` | `>` |

**Try writing the Bash and Python versions for Task 14!** (Remember to try the `[[ ... && ... ]]` syntax in Bash for a more modern approach).
