### **Task 28: Exit Codes and "Failing Fast"**

In a DevOps pipeline (like Jenkins or GitHub Actions), the system needs to know if your script succeeded or failed. It doesn't read your `echo` statements; it looks at the **Exit Code**.

* **0**: Success
* **1 to 255**: Failure (different numbers can represent different types of errors).

**The Goal:**

1. Try to change directory (`cd`) into a folder that doesn't exist (e.g., `/tmp/no_folder`).
2. **If it fails:** Print "Error: Directory not found" and **exit the script immediately** with a status of `1`.
3. If it succeeds, print "Success" and exit with `0`.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: `exit` and `$?**`

* `exit 1`: Stops the script and sends a failure signal.
* `||`: The "OR" operator. A common shorthand is: `cd /dir || exit 1`.

#### **2. Python: `sys.exit()**`

To send an exit code in Python, you need the `sys` module.

* `import sys`
* `sys.exit(0)` for success.
* `sys.exit(1)` for failure.

#### **3. Try/Except (Python)**

Instead of just checking if a folder exists, Pythonistas "try" the action and "catch" the error if it fails.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 28?**

**Next Step:** Once you master exit codes, we'll look at **Task 29: Environment Variables**. This is how we store configurations without hardcoding them into the script! Ready?
