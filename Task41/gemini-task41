### **Task 41: Remote Connectivity (SSH Check)**

DevOps is rarely about just one computer. You will often manage hundreds of servers. Before running a script on a remote machine, you need to check if you can actually reach it via **SSH**.

**The Goal:**

1. Check if you can connect to a remote server (let's use a fake IP: `192.168.1.100`) via SSH.
2. **The Constraint:** You don't want the script to hang forever if the server is down. Set a **timeout of 5 seconds**.
3. **Action:** Just check the connection; don't actually run any commands.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Bash: SSH with BatchMode**

When scripting, we use special flags so SSH doesn't ask for a password or get stuck on "Are you sure you want to connect?".

* `-o ConnectTimeout=5`: Gives up after 5 seconds.
* `-o BatchMode=yes`: Prevents the script from hanging on a password prompt.
* `exit`: We append `exit` at the end so it logs in and immediately logs out.

#### **2. Python: `subprocess` with timeout**

In Python, we can control how long we wait for a command to finish using the `timeout` argument in `subprocess.run()`.

* `subprocess.run([...], timeout=5)`
* If the server is down, Python will raise a `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception, which you can catch with `try/except`.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 41?**

**Next Step:** Once you can check connections, we'll look at **Task 42: Transferring Files (SCP)**. We'll learn how to programmatically move a backup from your local machine to that remote server! Ready to start moving data?
