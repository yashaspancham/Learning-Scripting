### **Task 27: Permissions and Ownership (The Linux Security Core)**

As a DevOps Engineer, you will often find that a script fails because it doesn't have "permission" to read a file (like `/etc/shadow`) or execute a tool. You need to be able to check and change these programmatically.

**The Goal:**

1. Check if a specific file (e.g., `audit_log.txt`) is **writable** by your script.
2. If it is NOT writable, change the permissions so that only the owner has read/write access (octal `600`).
3. Verify the change.

### **New Concepts**

#### **1. Octal Permissions**

* `7`: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1)
* `6`: Read (4) + Write (2)
* `4`: Read only
* **Common DevOps codes:** `755` (Public scripts), `600` (Private keys/secrets), `644` (Config files).

#### **2. Bash: `chmod` and Test Operators**

* `-w`: Check if file is writable.
* `chmod`: Change mode.
* **Syntax:** `chmod 600 filename`

#### **3. Python: `os.access` and `os.chmod**`

* `os.access(path, os.W_OK)`: Returns True if writable.
* `os.chmod(path, 0o600)`: The `0o` prefix tells Python the number is **octal**.

**Can you write the Bash and Python versions for Task 27?**

**Next Step:** After permissions, we need to talk about **Task 28: Exit Codes & Logic branching**. A professional script needs to "die gracefully" and tell the system *why* it failed. Would you like to tackle that next?
